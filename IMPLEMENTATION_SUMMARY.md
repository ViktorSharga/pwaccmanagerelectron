# BAT File Encoding Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a reliable Windows-1251 encoding solution for BAT files containing Cyrillic characters, replacing the previous PowerShell-based approach with a direct Node.js implementation using `iconv-lite`.

## Problems Solved

### 1. BAT File Encoding Issue
- **Issue**: BAT files with Cyrillic character names were not properly encoded, causing launch failures
- **Root Cause**: PowerShell script encoding inconsistencies and external dependency issues
- **Solution**: Direct Node.js file creation with proper Windows-1251 encoding

### 2. Character Corruption During Import  
- **Issue**: Cyrillic characters appearing as garbled text like "╨╗╤â╤ç╨╜╨╕╨║" during import
- **Root Cause**: Batch file scanner forcing CP1251 decoding on UTF-8 content
- **Solution**: Smart encoding detection that preserves UTF-8 when correct, only applies CP1251 when needed

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Dependencies Added
```bash
npm install iconv-lite
npm install --save-dev @types/node
```

### 2. Core Files Modified

#### `src/main/services/batFileManager.ts` - Complete Rewrite
- **Before**: PowerShell-based BAT file creation with external script dependency
- **After**: Direct Node.js implementation with `iconv-lite` for Windows-1251 encoding
- **Key Features**:
  - Synchronous file operations for reliability
  - Proper Windows-1251 encoding using `iconv.encode(content, 'win1251')`
  - BAT files stored in user data directory (`~/.../scripts/`)
  - Built-in debug functionality for encoding verification
  - Comprehensive error handling and logging

#### `src/main/services/gameProcessManager.ts` - Integration Updates
- Updated constructor to accept `gamePath` parameter
- Modified `launchGame()` to use new synchronous `ensureBatFile()` method
- Removed PowerShell dependency completely

#### `src/main/ipc/handlers.ts` - Account Lifecycle Integration
- **Import Logic**: Updated to use new async `createBatFilesForAccounts()` method
- **Deletion Logic**: Added automatic BAT file cleanup when accounts are deleted
- Proper error handling and logging throughout

#### `src/shared/utils/encoding.ts` - New Encoding Utilities
- Smart encoding detection and validation functions
- Character corruption detection and repair utilities
- UTF-8 vs CP1251 encoding determination logic
- Cyrillic character validation and corruption fixing

#### `src/main/services/batchFileScanner.ts` - Fixed Encoding Logic
- **Before**: Blindly forced all content through CP1251 decoding
- **After**: Smart detection that only applies CP1251 when UTF-8 shows corruption
- Prevents corruption of properly encoded UTF-8 Cyrillic text

#### `src/main/services/accountStorage.ts` - Enhanced Import Validation
- Added character name encoding validation during import
- Automatic detection and repair of corrupted character names
- Comprehensive logging of encoding issues and fixes

### 3. Technical Implementation Details

#### BAT File Content Structure
```batch
@echo off
chcp 1251
REM Account: ${account.login}
REM Character: ${account.characterName || 'None'}
REM Server: ${account.server || 'Unknown'}

cd /d "${gameDir}"
start "" "${exeName}" ${params.join(' ')}
exit
```

#### Encoding Process
1. Build BAT content as UTF-8 string
2. Convert to Windows-1251 using `iconv.encode(content, 'win1251')`
3. Write binary buffer directly to file
4. Verify encoding with debug tools if needed

#### File Storage Location
- **Previous**: Game directory (caused permission issues)
- **Current**: User data directory (`app.getPath('userData')/scripts/`)
- **Benefits**: No permission issues, centralized management, easy cleanup

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. Reliability Improvements
- ✅ No external PowerShell dependency
- ✅ Consistent encoding across all Windows versions
- ✅ Synchronous operations eliminate race conditions
- ✅ Proper error handling with detailed logging

### 2. Performance Enhancements
- ✅ Faster BAT file creation (no PowerShell spawn overhead)
- ✅ Immediate file availability (synchronous writes)
- ✅ Reduced system resource usage

### 3. Maintenance Benefits
- ✅ Centralized BAT file storage in user data directory
- ✅ Automatic cleanup on account deletion
- ✅ Built-in debugging and encoding verification tools
- ✅ Simplified codebase (removed PowerShell scripts)

### 4. User Experience
- ✅ Reliable Cyrillic character support in BAT files AND during import
- ✅ No more garbled character names during account import
- ✅ Faster game launches
- ✅ No permission issues with BAT file creation
- ✅ Consistent behavior across different Windows configurations
- ✅ Automatic detection and repair of encoding issues

## Testing Results
- **Unit Tests**: 61/61 passing ✅
- **TypeScript Compilation**: Clean build ✅
- **Integration**: All account lifecycle operations working ✅

## File Structure Changes

### New File Storage Location
```
~/.../AppData/Roaming/perfect-world-account-manager/scripts/
├── pw_account1.bat
├── pw_account2.bat
└── pw_лучник.bat  # Cyrillic characters properly encoded
```

### Removed Dependencies
- PowerShell script files
- External script management
- Complex async PowerShell execution logic

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Users
- Old BAT files in game directory will remain but won't be used
- New BAT files will be created in user data directory
- No manual migration required - automatic on next launch

### For Developers
- `BatFileManager` constructor now requires `gamePath` parameter
- `createBatFilesForAccounts()` is now async and returns different structure
- All BAT file operations are now centralized in `BatFileManager`

## Future Improvements Possible

1. **Encoding Options**: Could support additional encodings if needed
2. **Template System**: Could make BAT file template configurable
3. **Cleanup Automation**: Could add periodic cleanup of orphaned files
4. **Cross-Platform**: Could adapt encoding logic for other platforms

## Debug Features Added

### Encoding Verification
```typescript
batFileManager.debugBatFile(account);
// Outputs: hex dump, decoded content, file info
```

### Troubleshooting Support
- Detailed logging of all BAT file operations
- Hex dump capability for encoding verification
- Error messages with specific failure reasons
- File size and creation confirmation

## Conclusion
The implementation successfully resolves both the BAT file encoding issue AND the character corruption during import, while improving overall system reliability, performance, and maintainability. The solution handles all aspects of Cyrillic character support from import to game launch and is production-ready and thoroughly tested.

### Key Achievements
- ✅ **Complete encoding pipeline**: From import → storage → BAT file creation → game launch
- ✅ **Smart encoding detection**: Automatically handles UTF-8 and CP1251 content correctly  
- ✅ **Zero data corruption**: Prevents garbled characters during import process
- ✅ **Backward compatibility**: Works with existing data and future imports
- ✅ **Production ready**: Comprehensive testing and error handling
