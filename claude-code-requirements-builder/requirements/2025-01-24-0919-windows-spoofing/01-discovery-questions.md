# Discovery Questions - Windows Spoofing Implementation

## Q1: Is this feature specifically for enhancing the existing Windows spoofing capabilities that already exist in the systemIdentifierManager?
**Default if unknown:** YES - The codebase already has Windows spoofing implemented, so this likely extends it

## Q2: Should the spoofing modifications include hardware identifiers beyond the current Product ID and Computer Name (e.g., MAC address, disk serial)?
**Default if unknown:** YES - Games often check multiple hardware identifiers for multi-client detection

## Q3: Will users need a user interface to manually configure which identifiers to spoof?
**Default if unknown:** NO - The current implementation auto-generates random identifiers which works well

## Q4: Should the spoofing persist across system reboots?
**Default if unknown:** NO - Temporary spoofing during game sessions is safer and current implementation follows this pattern

## Q5: Will this feature need to support spoofing for specific games beyond Perfect World?
**Default if unknown:** YES - Making it game-agnostic increases utility for users with different games
